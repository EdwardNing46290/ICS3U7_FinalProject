# Batch file raises errors

    When running the batch file, the terminal will show several errors.

    This is normal, not preventable, and does not affect the game.

## Reason for the errors

    The program imports classes from the .jar files (in jfreechart package).

    These classes are necessary to create graphs.

    The terminal does not account for the .jar files, so it says that the imported classes are not found.


# Typing test game

    If the user types a word wrong, their words per minute (WPM) may be inaccurate.

    For best results, type every word correctly.
