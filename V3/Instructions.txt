# Batch file raises errors

    When running the batch file, the terminal will show several errors.

    This is not preventable, and stops the game from running properly.

    This game is only runnable in an IDE. Be sure to set the .jar files as libraries.

    The creator of jfreechart unfortunately did not make their program work for batch files.

## Reason for the errors

    The program imports classes from the .jar files (in jfreechart package).

    These classes are necessary to create graphs.


# Typing test game

    If the user types a word wrong, their words per minute (WPM) may be inaccurate.

    For best results, type every word correctly.

## Test results line graph

    The chart is interactive, meaning clicking and dragging on the chart may change the zoom.
